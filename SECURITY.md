## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **Do not** open public issues for security-sensitive topics.
2. Navigate to the repository's **Security** tab and start a private advisory.
3. Provide as much detail as possible:
   - Affected build (stable/beta), device model and Android version.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Any logs or screenshots that illustrate the impact.
4. Expect an acknowledgement within 48 hours. We aim to deliver fixes or
   mitigations within 14 days depending on severity.

For urgent matters that may impact a broad user base, note the severity in the
advisory title so the on-call engineer can prioritise appropriately.
